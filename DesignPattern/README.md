Design Patterns
	- Creational
	- Structural
	- behavioral

Purpose:
	- Creational
		concern the process of class/object creation
	- Structural
		composition of classes/objects
	- Behavioral
		characterize the ways in which classes/objects interact and distribute responsibility

Scope:
	- Class
		1. Deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses
		2. Established through inheritance
		3. Static-fixed at compile time
	- Object
		1. Deal with object relationships
		2. Changable at runtime and more dynamic
